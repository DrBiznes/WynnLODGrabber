## WynnLODGrabber

WynnLODGrabber is for Wynncraft modpack makers to allow users to automatically download the server LODs without having to mess with any files themselves. Or if you not making a modpack this is the lazy way to download lods i guess!!!

### Installation

WynnLODGrabber is a mod built for the [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/). It requires [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api), [Wynntills](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config), and [Distant Horizons](https://modrinth.com/mod/distanthorizons) to be installed separately.

# Make sure to change DH Config to "Server Folder Mode: IP Only" (under multiplayer in DH settings) and connect to play.wynncraft.com
